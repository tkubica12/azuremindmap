	What tends to be good to start with
		Short project, easy to migrate
		Self contained app with clear dependencies
		Big impact after migration
			Bad app in VM moved to Azure VM might be fine, but won't shine
			DevTest - rapid improvement, not waiting for VM for 2 weeks
			Modernize app with PaaS, better looking, faster, new features - everybody will notice
			Safe 50% or more costs due to autoscaling (VM Sets, App Services, containers, ...)
			Change the game - serverless etc.
		Big improvement for large set of apps without changing them
			StorSimple
			SQL Stretch DB
			Azure MFA
			Backup to Azure
			DR to Azure
		Categorize apps in 4-quadrant diagram
			High Value / Easy to migrate - main focus on start
			High Value / Difficult to migrate - long term bets
			Low Value / Easy to migrate - quick wins
			Low Value / Difficult to migrate - pursue later
	Do not miss opportunity to modernize (start with biggest gains)
		1. look at SaaS options with Office 365, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, ...
		2. look into modernize your apps to PaaS, learn to develop in cloud
		3. build application in cloud
		4. lift and shift VMs to cloud
		5. App not ready? Leave it in privat cloud and start with different one
	Recommended principles
		Lean
			Fail fast, learn fast, scale fast
			Try many, use what works
		Push the boundaries
			Design new application for PaaS
			Refactor legacy for PaaS
			Create PoR (to-do list for getting cloud benefits)
		Make data-driven decisions
			Experiment, get feedback and experience
			Manage your costs
			Use telemetry
			Understand your blockers
			Manage your PoR
		Simplify
			Retire legacy when it no longer has business purpose
			Right-size
			Clean-up your CMDB
			Review apps and resources with close-to-zero usage
		Communicate
			Be transparent, communicate lows, higs, impact
			Understand stakeholders, find power sponsor
			Share learnings and best practicies
	Typical strategy
		Understand your existing applications, create catalog
		Define criteria to identify good candidates to move/modernize
		Architect integration of cloud to your IT (identity, networking, security)
		Learn to develop in cloud
		Revisit you change management and processes
Why Azure
	Economies of scale, cost sharing
		Less overhead (example: cloud control plane nodes)
		Special hardware sharing (FPGA, neural networks, HSM)
		Efficient admin/server ratio (time investment into automation)
		Maximum security (policy, auditing, physical, data wiping)
	Flexible cost (pay-as-you-go)
		Get more at a minute you need (Christmas, Black Friday)
		Turn some resources off and stop paying (night, summer, weekend)
		No risky investment, lean and agile approach (try and learn)
	Innovation cycle
		No need to wait for depreciation (change what you use when you like)
	Instantly available
		Get it when you need it (no new tender, order, installation)
		No need to spend year building platform, just use it (time to market)
	Automated - DevOps and Infrastructure as Code
		Repeatable
		More secure and under control
		Executable documentation (Infra as code)
		Collaboration and sharing
Azure TCO/ROI
	Why static TCO calculation does not work for cloud
		Resources can be allocated dynamicaly, use when needed
		Agility brings more business value (harder to calculate)
	TCO tips
		Always ask about utilization
		Understand static TCO baseline
			Compute cost
				Understand physical resources
				Virtualization ratio (VMs per host)
				Virtualized percentage (virtualized vs. physical workloads)
			Storage cost
				Primary array
				NAS/DAS
				Backup
				Archiving
			Networking cost (LAN/SAN)
			Electricity
			Facility (Data Center)
			Virtualization cost
			Software (OS) cost
			IT labor
				VMs / servers per admin
				Include time-off etc.
		Understand seasonality and dynamics of business
			Resources needed vs. release cycle of Dev teams
			Day vs. night needs
			Batch processing
			Seasonal effects (Christmas, Holidays, Weekends, ...)
			Events and marketing (how drives resource needs)
			Example:
				On-premise - acceptable user experience
					Need to run 5 VMs
				Cloud - better user experience
					Run 3-8 VMs (dynamic number based on load) - 5 VMs in averga
					Run 1-3 VMs over night - 1 VMs on average
					Run 1-3 VMs over weekend - 2 VMs on average
					Run 10 VMs before Christmass
					Run 3 VMs on holidays
					Counting just one ordinary week - about 40% savings in resources needed
		Indirect costs
			What is cost of downtime
			Lost productivity due to waiting (eg. DevTest waiting for resources)
			Slower time-to-market due to slow releases
			Missed market opportunities
				Not able to mine data customer already has
				Not able to deliver modern services and interfaces before competition
			Inability to run cheap experiments hurts innovation
				Less learning
				Costly bets
				Too expensive mistakes
